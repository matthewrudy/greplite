Greplite 
========

Greplite is an example app featured in Chapter 3 of Rust in Action
https://www.manning.com/books/rust-in-action

I've modified it a bit to match some more features of grep.

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewrudy/greplite && cd greplite
cargo run -- --context 2 oo haystack.txt
```
